Research Question: Which socioeconomic and behavioral factors best predict student performance across Math and Portuguese?

By applying modern machine learning algorithms to the Student Performance dataset, this project aims to identify which socioeconomic and behavioral factors most strongly predict academic success across both subjects. Understanding these patterns can help educators and policymakers recognize which students thrive despite disadvantage– resilient learners and which groups are most vulnerable to falling behind. These insights can inform targeted academic support programs, resource allocation, and interventions that not only narrow achievement gaps but also foster equitable learning environments where all students have the opportunity to succeed.

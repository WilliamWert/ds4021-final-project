# DS4021-final-project

**Project Overview**        
This repository contains the final project for DS 4021: Machine Learning, focused on predicting student math performance using socioeconomic and behavioral variables. Four machine learning models, Elastic Net, Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boosting, and a PyTorch neural network, were implemented, tuned using cross-validation, and evaluated on a held-out test set. All code, documentation, and results are organized for clarity and reproducibility.

By applying modern machine learning algorithms to the Student Performance dataset, this project aims to identify which socioeconomic and behavioral factors most strongly predict academic success. Understanding these patterns can help educators and policymakers recognize which students thrive despite disadvantage– resilient learners and which groups are most vulnerable to falling behind. These insights can inform targeted academic support programs, resource allocation, and interventions that not only narrow achievement gaps but also foster equitable learning environments where all students have the opportunity to succeed.

**Research Question:** Which socioeconomic and behavioral factors best predict student performance in Math?
